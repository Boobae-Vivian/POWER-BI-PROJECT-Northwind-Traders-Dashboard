# NORTHWIND TRADERS DASHBOARD

## INTRODUCTION

In the ever-evolving realm of trading, the importance of well-informed decision-making cannot be overstated. Our mission is to empower traders with actionable insights and simplify their analytical workflows through the development of an advanced Tracking Dashboard. This dashboard is intricately designed, utilizing the extensive 'Northwind Traders' dataset, which encompasses seven diverse datasets, collectively painting a comprehensive picture of trading activities.

Our primary objective is to equip traders with a potent tool that transcends raw data, converting it into actionable intelligence. The Tracking Dashboard is geared towards providing a holistic perspective on key performance indicators (KPIs), crucial for strategic analysis and offering a thorough overview of trading performance. Beyond this, the dashboard aims to delve deeper into trading dynamics, uncovering insights such as identifying underperforming companies based on total quantity traded, spotlighting the top 5 countries ranked by total unit price, etc.

The Tracking Dashboard is a testament to our unwavering commitment to delivering a robust and user-friendly solution, fostering informed decision-making within the intricate landscape of trading.
