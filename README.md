# NORTHWIND TRADERS DASHBOARD

## INTRODUCTION

In the ever-evolving realm of trading, the importance of well-informed decision-making cannot be overstated. Our mission is to empower traders with actionable insights and simplify their analytical workflows through the development of an advanced Tracking Dashboard. This dashboard is intricately designed, utilizing the extensive 'Northwind Traders' dataset, which encompasses seven diverse datasets, collectively painting a comprehensive picture of trading activities.

Our primary objective is to equip traders with a potent tool that transcends raw data, converting it into actionable intelligence. The Tracking Dashboard is geared towards providing a holistic perspective on key performance indicators (KPIs), crucial for strategic analysis and offering a thorough overview of trading performance. Beyond this, the dashboard aims to delve deeper into trading dynamics, uncovering insights such as identifying underperforming companies based on total quantity traded, spotlighting the top 5 countries ranked by total unit price, etc.

The Tracking Dashboard is a testament to our unwavering commitment to delivering a robust and user-friendly solution, fostering informed decision-making within the intricate landscape of trading.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

1. Generate five (5) key performance indicators (KPIs) comprising:
   - Total Unit Price
   - Total Discount
   - Total Quantity
   - Total Freight
   - Average Delivery Duration

2. Identify and highlight companies with the lowest total quantity traded
3. Determine and showcase the top five(5) countries based on total unit price
4. Ascertain the total unit prices by category name
5. Highlight the top three (3) countries with the highest total quantity traded
6. Illustrate the distribution of total Freight costs by Employee Name
7. Integrate a dynamic "Year Slicer" for data filtering based on specific years.

This comprehensive outline aims to address key problem statements and guide the development of an effective tracking dashboard for traders using the 'Northwind Traders' dataset.

## SKILLS AND CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED

In creating a tracking dashboard for traders using Power BI with the 'Northwind Traders' dataset, several skills and concepts need to be demonstrated. Here is a breakdown of the essential skills and concepts:

- Data Import and Transformation
- Data Modeling
- Visualization Techniques
- KPI Creation Utilizing DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Data Aggregation and Calculation
- Hierarchical Analysis: Demonstrate the ability to analyze data hierarchically, such as by category name or employee name
- Dashboard Interaction: Implement interactive features like slicers, filters, and drill-through actions to enhance user control.
- Documentation and Presentation

By effectively demonstrating these skills and concepts, the Power BI dashboard will serve as a powerful tool for traders, providing actionable insights and facilitating informed decision-making in the trading domain.

## DEVELOPING THE NORTHWIND TRADERS DASHBOARD: STEPS, ANALYSIS, AND DISCUSSIONS

Import the 'Northwind Traders' dataset, consisting of seven distinct datasets, into Power BI Desktop by adhering to the prescribed steps outlined in my work titled "Power BI Task 1: Data Integration".[Access the document here](https://github.com/Boobae-Vivian/POWER-BI-TASK-1-Dataset-Integration). As a result of this process, you will observe the presence of seven(7) datasets—categories, customers, employees, order_details, orders, products, and shippers—in the data pane within the Power BI environment. These datasets will be highlighted by a yellow line, as depicted in the snapshot below.

Kindly note that the imported datasets underwent data cleaning; however, unfortunately, snapshots were not taken during the cleaning process of the seven datasets. Nevertheless, it's important to note that a separate task focused on data cleaning, using an employee CSV dataset, has been completed. This task is extensively documented in my work on data cleaning and transformation, specifically detailed in Power BI Task 2.
